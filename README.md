# Project_Statement
# Identifying Fake Images using Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify fake images generated by AI algorithms. The sophisticated AI techniques has made it easier to create fake identities, leading to an increase in identity fraud and online security threat.

# Data Breakdown
The dataset provided for this project is obtained from bitgrit, and it consists of labeled images with corresponding target variables indicating whether an image is real or fake. The dataset is divided into two main files:

train.csv: This file is intended for training the machine learning model. It contains image data along with their corresponding labels. The target variable has two categories: 0 represents 'real' images, and 1 represents 'fake' images.

test.csv: This file is meant for evaluating the performance of the trained model on unseen data. You will use this file to make predictions with your trained model and create a submission file.

Additionally, a solution_format file is provided, which serves as an example of the required format for the submission file.
I have provided the result file for testing data as results.csv and code of same in python

The data can be downloaded from https://bitgrit.net/competition/18
# Note
Please ensure that you have the necessary environment set up and required dependencies installed to run the provided code and work with the dataset effectively.
