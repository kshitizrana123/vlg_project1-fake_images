# Project_Statement
We are provided with a dataset from bitgrit which is a image dataset with labels 0,1 for fake and real images 
The goal is to develop a model that can identify a fake photo created by AI.as Fake identities can be easily created using sophisticated algorithms. This has led to an increase in identity fraud, as fake identities can be used to gain access to online services and commit fraudulent activities. Thus, the purpose is to contribute to the development of more secure and reliable online services for everyone.

# Data Breakdown
*DATA PROVIDED....
train.csv: file to train your machine learning model (labels: target variable with 0 being 'real' and 1 being 'fake')
test.csv: file that can be used to test how well your model performs on unseen data. This is the file you're going to make predictions on with your trained model and create a submission file.
solution_format: Example of the format that the submission file needs to be in to be properly scored

I have provided the result file for testing data as results.csv and code of same in python
The data can be downloaded from https://bitgrit.net/competition/18
